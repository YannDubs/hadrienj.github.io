I'm currently doing a PhD (end expected Dec. 2018) in Cognitive Sciences at the &Eacute;cole Normale Sup√©rieure (ENS) in Paris, France. I'm studying auditory perceptual learning (pitch perception and auditory selective attention) using psychophysics and electrophysiology (EEG).

#### Web Development . Full-Stack

During my PhD I learned web developement (<span class='salient'>Django</span>/<span class='salient'>Javascript</span>) in order to build portable auditory experiments running on computers and tablets. I especially love the new features of Javascript (<span class='salient'>ES6-ES7</span>) and the fast evolution of the language. I also extensively used databases (<span class='salient'>CouchDB</span> on a virtual server / <span class='salient'>PouchDB</span> in the browser) to build offline-first web app. I also played with <span class='salient'>D3</span> and <span class='salient'>React</span> to build data vizualisation on the web. The <span class='salient'>Web Audio API</span> was my companion these last years. I used it to create sounds with controled features on the web (for instance [a demo](https://fm-am.auditory.fr/) of amplitude and frequency modulation with visualizations).

#### Data Science

Passionate about data analysis and very keen to learn new things, I use <span class='salient'>R</span> to analyse behavioral data and create vizualisations and <span class='salient'>Python</span> to analyse EEG data (see [my toolbox](https://github.com/hadrienj/EEG) for EEG processing) and elaborate an offline and online signal processing workflow. I also tried to bind data science, signal processing and web developement by creating a neurofeedback app that streamed and transfered the data from the EEG system to a web server in <span class='salient'>Django</span> and get the data in the browser with <span class='salient'>web sockets</span> for final feedback display.
