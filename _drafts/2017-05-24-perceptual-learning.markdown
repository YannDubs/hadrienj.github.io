Some review in the field of perceptual learning

# Theoretical background

## Perceptual learning as reduction of internal noise

@jones_reduction_2013

Several factors could impact the performance and be included in perceptual learning models.

### Internal noise

Internal noise could come from multiple factor from the cochlea to central brain areas: brownian motion of hair cells, stochastic neural encoding, physiological factors like blood flow.

### Encoding efficiency

Internal noise is independent of encoding efficiency that concerns the ability to put two stimuli (for exemple each interval in a 2I-2AFC frequency discrimination) in two different channels in order to differentiate them. Each channel would have the same amount of internal noise.

### Response bias

Preference for one response when the stimulus is around threshold.

### Inattentiveness



## Neural mechanisms

@watanabe_perceptual_2015: at which level of processing perceptual learning occurs (from vision studies): early-stage, mid-stage or late-stage models.

### Reverse hierarchy theory

Perception is thought to encode features in a hierarchical way with the basic and local features encoded early on the neural pathway and the global and more complex features encoded on higher brain structures.

This allow **generalization** in cases where low-level features are different but higher representations are similar (e.g same object at different distance from the observer), and **divergence** when 2 identical stimuli belong to different categories (e.g. two identical sounds interpreted as different phonological categories). Ex from @watanabe_perceptual_2015.

According to the reverse hierarchy theory the first (faster) accessible representation is the higher order one. This implies that the low-level features require further processing to be accessed.

See: Nahum, M., Nelken, I. & Ahissar, M. 2008 Low-level information and high-level perception: the case of speech in noise. PLoS Biol. 6, e126. (doi:10.1371/journal.pbio. 0060126).

#### Backward search

When the higher representation in not informative enough to perform well on the task, a *backward search* can be made where lower-level features are searched for to increase performances on the task. This leads to loose the higher-order representation. This requires long or repeated stimuli to find the most informative level.

For a psychophysical task the first high order representation is used for the first trial but along repetitions a backward search allow to use lower-level representation more suited to discriminate low-level stimulus features.

If there is a wide roving low-level representation is not easily accessible and performances are poorer. The use of a standard reference across trial leads to better thresholds ("low-level thresholds").

The fact that better performances are induced by increasing tuning in low-level brain areas explains also that this kind of perceptual learning is specific to dimensions that are distinguished at low-level but not high-level representations.

If limitation of performances is not low-level features, learning can consist in an improvements of higher order abilities (e.g. memory; @pelli_feature_2006).

Access to low-level features in backward search needs blocked presentation (= not interleaved). However RHT predict that interleaved presentation will lead to more generalization (Fig 4.). This last hypothesis isn't falsified by experimental data? No learning with roving ()



### Early-stage models

- High specificity (orientation, location, eye etc.)

## Learning as 're-tuning' the decision template

@li_perceptual_2004

## Generalization and specificity of training

### Complete roving (random)

### Temporal patterning

#### @kuai_essential_2005

Training with temporal pattern instead of random roving allow learning. This learning transfer to random roving and other temporal pattern conditions.

## Task-relevent or task-irrelevent learning

@watanabe_perceptual_2015



## Influence of difficulty of training

### @amitay_discrimination_2006

- Tags: difficulty, transfer
- Task: frequency discrimination (3-intervals 3-alternative, oddball)
- Training duration: 1h (main improvements at the mid-test: 30 minutes training)

Results:

- Improvements when training on same stimuli. Either:
    + Learning in pre. But no improvement for control group (pre-reading-post).
    + Learning with only exposition to target. There is also improvements for group trained on other frequency = 2 distinct mechanisms?
    + The authors suggest that learning can be related to the ability to focus attention on the required stimulus dimension.
- Transfer from 4 KHz to 1KHz.

The authors suggest multiple learning mechanisms:

- Bottom-up: increased response to the standard stimulus
- Top-down: increased selective attention on the stimulus dimension. Studies show that auditory event-related potentials are generated only for attended stimuli in the auditory cortex. This influence of attention might occur in low-level processing structure (ERP at 20 ms after sound onset). See Woldorff, M., Hillyard, S., Gallen, C.C., Hampson, S.R. & Bloom, F.E. Magnetoence- phalographic recordings demonstrate attentional modulation of mismatch- related neural activity in human auditory cortex. Psychophysiology 35, 283â€“292(1998).
- Supra-modal task-related mechanism (computer use)

## Stimulus variability (stimulus uncertainty)

### @amitay_auditory_2005

- Tags: roving, transfer
- Task: higher tone (of two tones)
- Training duration: 6h
- Conditions: no roving, narrow roving and wide roving. Roving = change in frequency band (from 5 different bands) every trials (interleaved tracks).

Two types of transfer are assessed: across frequencies and across task condition (roving or no roving).

### @kuai_essential_2005

No learning with roving for contrast discrimination and motion-direction discrimination. Learning when the roving is not random but sequential. Same results with pre-cueing (presentation of the same gabor or motion-direction pattern before the trial): the authors ruled out the explanation of stimulus uncertainty impact.

## Early learning = procedural learning?

Certain studies use pretraining to avoid observing learning that is due to procedural improvements.

@hawkey_early_2004

- Tags: early, procedural, transfer
- Task: multiple
- Training duration: 2h
- Procedure: training - post-test. Four groups of participants did different training (frequency discrimination with 2I-2AFC, 3I-3AFC, intensity discrimination with 2I-2AFC and visual contrast discrimination with 2I-2AFC).

They show that early rapid perceptual learning is not procedural but perceptual.

# For mountain v2

- Split participants between good and poor (1/3, 2/3: threshold = under or over 2%): @amitay_auditory_2005.
- Different performances between groups in pre-test: @amitay_auditory_2005, @amitay_discrimination_2006.
- Only higher frequency for test tone (in comparison to standard tone): @hawkey_early_2004, @amitay_auditory_2005
- Log-transformed thresholds: @amitay_auditory_2005, @amitay_discrimination_2006.
- Feedback even for pre-test: @amitay_discrimination_2006.
- d' correction: see @macmillan_detection_2004 (or 2005?)
