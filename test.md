## Deep learning book series

<a href="/deep-learning-book-series-home" class='noDeco'>
In this series we will go through the chapter of linear algebra from [the Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/){:target="_blank"} from Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville (2016). It is made as 12 blog posts and their corresponding Python Notebooks designed to helping you get the linear algebra you need to do great things in machine learning and deep learning.
